# DLRec 

DLRec is a deep learning based approach to reconstruce high read-depth signals from low depth WGS data.
The technical details can be referred to the paper **Reconstruction of high read-depth singals from low-depth whole genome sequencing data using deep learning** attached in the doc fold.


## Enviroment
The implementation used Chainer as the backend deep learning toolkit. 
The docker image used for runing this code can be downloaded from https://hub.docker.com/r/yaozhong/dlrec/.
